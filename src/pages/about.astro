    <h3>About me</h3>

    <p>
      I'm CauÃª, a Software Engineer (a.k.a. code monkey) in Rio de Janeiro. I
      have a strong interest in a wide variety of computer science topics, such
      as Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages, Software Architecture,
      Games, Console Applications, and Networking. Over the years, I have
      delivered professional projects using TypeScript, JavaScript, C#, Go,
      Python, Rust, PowerShell, and GDScript. I love picking up new languages
      (my latest was Zig), although Go and C# are my current favorites.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a young age, I was the kind of curious kid who took toys apart just
      to see how they worked (and yes, that drove my parents a bit crazy). I
      discovered the world of programming when I was 14, driven by curiosity
      about how computer programs really worked behind the scenes. While
      googling, I stumbled upon Visual Basic 98, which let me create my own
      software. I started tinkering with it right away and quickly became fully
      immersed in the process of building programs. I spent countless nights
      downloading source code, mainly from <a
        href="https://www.macoratti.net/"
        target="_blank">Macoratti's site</a
      >, and it was always the same thing: I would download the code, modify it
      until it broke, and then figure out how and why it had broken. Without
      even noticing, I had built a solid understanding of programming logic
      simply by downloading and breaking programs for fun.
    </p>

    <p>
      At 17, I enrolled in a Systems Analysis and Development program in
      college, but it turned out to be a difficult experience due to personal
      circumstances. I decided to leave and ended up spending the next five
      years working in photography as both a photographer and as an account
      executive. That role helped me develop soft skills and a keen sense of
      aesthetics and design. Even in roles that did not require any programming
      at all, I could not resist automating tasks with Python, PHP, or even
      Adobe Photoshop Scripts whenever possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over time, I realized I genuinely enjoyed writing those scripts day in and
      day out and, modesty aside, felt I was at least somewhat decent at it. I
      began to consider giving programming a second chance as a professional
      career, but it was a difficult choice. After all, I had already spent a
      considerable number of years in another field, building up valuable
      expertise. Venturing into computer science meant going back to square one
      and letting go of what I had already achieved.
    </p>

    <p>
      After serious thought, I made the leap back to programming as a career. I
      returned to college for Information Systems and, this time, had a much
      more positive experience. I connected with inspiring professors and
      classmates who helped me catch up and move forward. Looking back, I know I
      made the right decision, and I am thrilled to work on what I love each
      day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of programming, I am passionate about cinema, philosophy,
      sociology, and I am a die-hard Flamengo fan. You can often find me at
      Recreio Beach, a karaoke bar, or meeting up with friends over music and a
      drink.
